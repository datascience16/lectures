    "This course focuses on developing practical skills in working with data and providing students with a hands-on understanding of classical data analysis techniques. As expected, this will be a code-intensive course. We have chosen [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the language to work with, since it allows for fast prototyping and is supported by a great variety of scientific (and, specifically, data related) libraries. For a quick introduction to Python, you can check [Lecture 1](https://github.com/datascience16/lectures/blob/master/Lecture1/Intro%20to%20Python.ipynb)."
